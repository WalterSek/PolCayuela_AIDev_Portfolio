    content: `## Problem Statement

Cooking content creators and enthusiasts face daily friction: they discover recipes through YouTube, Instagram, and blogs but have no structured way to save, organize, and cook them. When cooking time arrives, they're juggling a phone with flour-covered hands, scrolling back through videos to find specific steps.

**Existing tools don't solve this:**
- Pinterest/bookmarks: Save links but offer no cooking experience
- Generic recipe apps: Can't import from video descriptions or social posts
- Notes apps: Unstructured, not searchable, no hands-free mode

CookShelf bridges the gap between discovering a recipe and actually cooking it.
